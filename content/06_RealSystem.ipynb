    "The idea of Monte-Carlo simulations is to execute **a lot of small and independant simulations** and compute the final result based on the results of the simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, each simulation we draw a random number $x$ in $[-1, 1]$, and then compute (in a very inefficient way) $\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final result is the sum of each simulation, which is an approximation of $\\int_{-1}^1 \\sqrt{1-x^2}dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our sensor is the `loadavg` of the machine. The `loadavg` is a metric representing the CPU utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our actuator is the number of threads excuting simulations in parallel (between 0 and 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Our control objective is to control the `loadavg` metric around a given value by adapting the number of threads executing simulations.**\n",
